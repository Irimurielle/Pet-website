            <h3>Toys</h3>
            <p>To choose toys for your dogs, there are things you need to know:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Dogs look at toys the way <strong>wolves</strong> look at prey. So it’s not surprising that they tend to like toys that either taste like food, can be torn apart, and/or make a noise.</li>
                <li>Dogs find harder and quieter toys less interesting. After all, if they can’t chew into it and it doesn’t even make a peep, what’s the point? They want softer toys that can be more easily manipulated.</li>
                <li>Dogs are interested in new things. The Labs in the study were intensely interested in almost all of the toys… at first. But once they became familiar with them, they tended to lose interest.</li>
                <li>Dogs are more interested when you participate. As social creatures, our dogs become more <strong>excited</strong> when we’re excited. Engaging a dog in play using a toy is much more engaging than playing alone. A tug toy isn’t much good if there isn’t someone on the other side.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each dog has a unique personality and energy level, and therefore will have a unique preference for the type of toy he or she likes to play with. The bottom line? Playing with you is best, but if you hope to keep your dog engaged on his own, toys that can be chewed or easily manipulated are more likely to keep his interest.</p>
